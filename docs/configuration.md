# Notification bar
The template used for the notification bar is named "hijack/notifications.html", or "hijack/notifications_bootstrap.html" 
if Bootstrap is enabled.

## Bootstrap
If your project uses Bootstrap, you may want to set `HIJACK_USE_BOOTSTRAP = True` in your project settings.
Django Hijack will use a Bootstrap notification bar that does not overlap with the default navbar.

## Disabling the notification bar
You can temporarily disable the notification bar by setting `HIJACK_DISPLAY_WARNING = False`. 

# Permissions
By default, only superusers are allowed to hijack other users.
Django Hijack gives you a variety of options to extend the group of authorized users.

## Staff members
Set `HIJACK_AUTHORIZE_STAFF = True` in your project settings to authorize staff members to hijack non-staff users.
If you want staff to be able to hijack other staff as well, enable `HIJACK_AUTHORIZE_STAFF_TO_HIJACK_STAFF`.

Note that there is no option to authorize staff members to hijack superusers. This would make the distinction between staff users and superusers useless.

## Custom authorization function
Advanced Django developers might want to define their own check whether a user may hijack another user. This can be achieved by 
setting `HIJACK_AUTHORIZATION_CHECK` to the dotted path of a function which accepts two User 
objects – `hijacker` and `hijacked` – and returns a Boolean value. Example:

```python
# settings.py
HIJACK_AUTHORIZATION_CHECK = 'mysite.utils.my_authorization_check'
```

```python
# mysite.utils.py
def my_authorization_check(hijacker, hijacked):
    """
    Checks if a user is authorized to hijack another user
    """
    if my_condition:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

**Warning: The setting `HIJACK_AUTHORIZATION_CHECK` overrides the other hijack authorization settings. Defining a custom authorization function can have dangerous
effects on your application's authorization system. Potentially, it might allow any user to impersonate 
any other user and to take advantage of all their permissions.**

## Non-staff members
To allow non-staff members to hijack other users you need to set `HIJACK_DECORATOR` in addition to `HIJACK_AUTHORIZATION_CHECK`, otherwise the default `staff_member_required` will prevent non-staff members from using the hijack functionality. For example you can use an identity decorator:

```python
# settings.py
HIJACK_DECORATOR = 'mysite.utils.hijack_decorator'
```
```python
# mysite.utils.py
def mysite(f):
    return f
```

## Allowing GET method for hijack views
The hijack-specific views (hijack someone, release etc.) only accept POST requests by default. This is to avoid CSRF attacks on hijack functionality (cf. https://github.com/arteria/django-hijack/issues/84).
However, you want to forego this protection, e.g. if they want to integrate Django Hijack in the Django admin using <https://github.com/arteria/django-hijack-admin>.
In this case, you can set `HIJACK_ALLOW_GET_REQUESTS = True`.

## Custom view decorator
Django Hijack's views are decorated by Django's `staff_member_required` decorator. If you have written your own 
authorization function, or haven't installed `django.contrib.admin`, you may want to override this behaviour by 
setting `HIJACK_DECORATOR` to the dotted path of a custom decorator. Example:

```python
HIJACK_DECORATOR = 'mysite.decorators.mydecorator'
```

# Remote users
To work with `REMOTE_USER`,  place `'hijack.middleware.HijackRemoteUserMiddleware'`
between `'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware'` and `'django.contrib.auth.middleware.RemoteUserMiddleware'`:

```python
# settings.py
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    ...,
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'hijack.middleware.HijackRemoteUserMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.RemoteUserMiddleware',
    ...,
)
```
